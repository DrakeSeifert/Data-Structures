1. The Linked list uses the most memory. This is because to create more memory you must
   manipulate multiple different pointers and where they are pointing to for every single new
   element. The array on the other hand has pointers directly to its elements.

2. The Linked list is the fastest. This is because for every new element in the linked list,
   the element can simply be inserted into the middle. An array on the other hand has to
   move every single element if it wants to add or remove an element from the middle, thus
   making it much slower.

3. Yes, the program performs much quicker. This is because there are a significantly less 
   amount of elements that the loop has to iterate through, and therefore performed
   at a much quicker rate.
